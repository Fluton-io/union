This tutorial will demonstrate sending custom data using ucs03-zkgm.

The demonstration will act as a solution to [AOC 2024 - Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1). By the end of the tutorial, users will be able to send their list from a Solidity contract deployed on an EVM to a CosmWasm contract deployed on Union or elsewhere.
